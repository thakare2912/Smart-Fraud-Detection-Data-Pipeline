| Component           | Technology              |
|---------------------|--------------------------|
| Streaming Platform  | Apache Kafka (`confluent_kafka`) |
| Data Processing     | Apache Spark Structured Streaming |
| Storage Layer       | MinIO (S3-compatible object storage) |
| Orchestration       | Apache Airflow (modular DAGs) |
| Data Warehouse      | Snowflake               |
| Language            | Python                  |
| Data Format         | Parquet (partitioned)   |

##  Features

- Simulates real-time financial transactions using Kafka.
- Detects fraud using rule-based and conditional logic.
- Calculates:
  - Per-user spend trends
  - Product/category popularity metrics
- Writes partitioned Parquet files to MinIO (by year/month/day).
- Loads curated datasets into Snowflake using Airflow DAGs.
- Modular design with separate consumer, analytics, and loader logic.

## How It Works

### 1. **Kafka Producer**
- Simulates financial transactions with fields like `user_id`, `amount`, `payment_method`, etc.
- Sends them to a Kafka topic (`transactions`).

### 2. **Spark Structured Streaming**
- Consumes real-time messages from Kafka.
- Applies fraud detection rules:
  - High-value amount + suspicious location
  - Rapid-fire multiple transactions
- Computes:
  - `fraud_records`
  - `user_spend_trends`
  - `category_trends`
- Writes all outputs to MinIO in Parquet format, partitioned by date.

### 3. **Airflow DAGs**
- Scheduled DAGs read partitioned data from MinIO.
- Use Python-based loaders to:
  - Create Snowflake tables if not exist
  - Insert new data using merge/upsert
  - Track `last_updated` timestamps

## Architecture Overview

Below is a high-level diagram showing the main moving parts of the pipeline:

![Pipeline Architecture](pipeline_architecture.png)

| Component               | Technology / Purpose                                      |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Streaming Platform      | **Apache Kafka** via `confluent_kafka` for ingesting streaming transaction data |
| Real-time Processing    | **Apache Spark** Structured Streaming — rules & analytics |
| Storage Layer           | **MinIO** (S3-compatible object storage) for raw & processed data in Parquet format, partitioned by date |
| Orchestration & Workflow| **Apache Airflow** to schedule and run various DAGs (data ingestion, loading, cleanup) |
| Data Warehouse          | **Snowflake** for curated datasets & downstream analytics |
| Language(s)             | Python                                                  |
| Data Format             | Parquet (partitioned by year/month/day)                 |

## Features

- Simulates real-time transaction data with fields such as `user_id`, `amount`, `payment_method`, `timestamp`, etc.  
- Fraud detection logic based on rules, e.g.:  
  - Transactions above a high amount + suspicious location  
  - Multiple rapid successive transactions from same user  
- Computes additional analytics:  
  - Per-user spending trends over time  
  - Product / category popularity  
- Writes outputs (fraudulent transactions, trend metrics) to MinIO in partitioned Parquet format  
- Uses Airflow DAGs to automatically load curated datasets into Snowflake (with upserts / merges)  
- Modular design: separate components for producers, analytics, loaders, etc.

---

## Components & How It Works

1. **Kafka Producer**  
   Simulates financial transaction events and publishes to a Kafka topic (e.g. `transactions`).

2. **Spark Structured Streaming Consumer & Analytics**  
   - Reads from Kafka in real-time  
   - Applies fraud detection logic  
   - Generates analytic outputs: `fraud_records`, `user_spend_trends`, `category_trends`  
   - Outputs data stored in MinIO in Parquet format, partitioned by `year/month/day`

3. **Airflow DAGs / Data Loader**  
   - Periodically reads the processed data from MinIO  
   - Creates or ensures existence of necessary Snowflake tables  
   - Inserts / upserts data into Snowflake, tracking `last_updated` timestamps or watermark for incremental loads

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed / set up:

- Python 3.x  
- Docker & Docker Compose (if using containerization)  
- Apache Kafka cluster (or local dev version)  
- MinIO (S3‐compatible storage)  
- Apache Spark (with access to Kafka)  
- Apache Airflow  
- A Snowflake account (or other warehouse for testing, adjusting accordingly)  

### Setup

1. Clone the repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thakare2912/Smart-Fraud-Detection-Data-Pipeline.git
   cd Smart-Fraud-Detection-Data-Pipeline
Install required Python dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure environment variables / credentials:
You will need settings for:

Kafka bootstrap servers, topics

MinIO endpoint, access key, secret key, bucket names

Snowflake credentials (account, user, password, role, database, schema, warehouse)

Airflow configuration (e.g. connection settings to above, DAG folder etc.)

(Optional) Build and run via Docker / Docker Compose if setup is containerized.

Running the Pipeline
Start Kafka producer to simulate transactions.

Run the Spark streaming job to process the Kafka stream.

Use Airflow to schedule DAGs that load the data into Snowflake.

Monitor logs / dashboards as desired for fraud detection alerts and analytics output.

Configuration
Parquet partitioning: by year, month, day (path/MinIO layout)

Fraud rules: configurable thresholds (e.g. amount limits, time windows)

Airflow DAG schedule intervals: customizable per use case

Snowflake schema / table management: ability to create if missing; manage upserts

Data Flow & Storage
text
Copy code
Kafka (transactions topic)
      ↓
Spark Structured Streaming
      ↓
Raw / processed data → MinIO (Parquet) ─ partitioned by date
      ↓
Airflow DAGs
      ↓
Load into Snowflake (curated tables)
Raw Data: all transaction events as received

Processed Data: fraud records, user / category trends

Warehouse Data: curated, cleaned, ready for analytics / dashboarding

Deployment
Use Docker / Docker Compose for local development and integration testing

Use Kubernetes / cloud provider for production environments (if scaling)

Secure credentials via environment variables or secrets manager

Logging & monitoring: collect logs from Spark jobs, Airflow tasks; alert on failures or suspicious events

Future Enhancements
Implement a machine learning-based fraud detection model (not just rule-based)

Real-time alerting / notification (e.g. via email / SMS / dashboard)

Support more complex streaming sources (payment gateways, external event streams)

Data quality checks and data validation

Scaling: partitioning, high availability, fault-tolerance

Unit tests and integration tests for each component
